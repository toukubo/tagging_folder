usage: python tag.py 

## purpose: add foloder name to the internal files filename 
 e.g.
1. #foo/bar file becomes #foo/bar #foo


i am using this to do the tagging multiple tag, and use the folders for this purpose. 
move files to the "tag folders" once, and then run this, and the file names has the tags added.

ok if you are doing something like GTD, then you will use tags like @on_the_go or @done, etc.

but "tag" is not a folder ( category ). the major difference "multiple tags" on a object. in GTD's case you will have the context tags,and project tags, and status tags, and due and priority. or those.

i am more on "text base task" like task paper and todo.txt. so file and folder operations makes everything. if you are on shell and tasks, folder operations shell works makes this. and also GUIs to handle files gives you tagging operations. 

i usually use #inbox tag, it is very like gmail labeling inbox opeartions. gmail has #inbox label to all the incoming emails. and doing the operations.  
-> moving files to one of the "tagging" folders. to store files in "tagging" folder does NOT mean the file is in that folder. but it will be "tagged with that" and then they will be moved. it means it will be tagged, but not stays in the folder. 
 
 using Finder x terminal, and then move the files to many folders again and again. by this you can operation pick and add attribute ( tag ) to the files and let objects comes back and flowing into the workflow.
